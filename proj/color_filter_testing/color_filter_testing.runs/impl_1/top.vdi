INFO: [Place 46-3] During incremental compilation, routing data from the original checkpoint is applied during place_design. As a result, dangling route segments and route conflicts may appear in the post place_design implementation due to changes between the original and incremental netlists. These routes can be ignored as they will be subsequently resolved by route_design. This issue will be cleaned up automatically in place_design in a future software release.
